# 1. Introduction
Sorting algorithms are a fundamental topic in computer science and are critical in learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Sorting Visualizer is an interactive web application that visualizes the process of different sorting algorithms step by step. The aim of the project is to provide a better understanding of how sorting algorithms work and how they perform on various input arrays.

# 2. Objective
The objective of this project is to create an engaging tool that helps students visualize and learn different sorting algorithms effectively. This interactive tool allows users to select various algorithms, adjust the size of the array, and control the sorting speed. Additionally, it ensures that students can see the real-time sorting process of arrays through animations.

# 3. Project Overview
This project allows the user to:

Visualize the process of sorting through animations.
Choose from different sorting algorithms.
Control the array size and sorting speed.
Display a message when the array is already sorted.

# 3.1 Technology Stack
Frontend Framework: React.js
Styling: CSS
Icons: React Icons
Development Tools: Visual Studio Code, GitHub

# 3.2 User Interface
The user interface consists of an array visualization area and control buttons that allow the user to:

Generate a new array.
Select a sorting algorithm (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort).
Adjust the array size using a slider.
Control the sorting speed with a slider.
View the sorting process through smooth animations.

# 4. Algorithms Implemented
# 4.1 Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

# 4.2 Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It picks an element and places it in its correct position by comparing it with previous elements.

# 4.3 Quick Sort
Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

# 4.4 Merge Sort
Merge Sort is a stable, comparison-based sorting algorithm that works by dividing the array into smaller sub-arrays and recursively sorting and merging them.

# 5. Key Features
Dynamic Array Generation: Users can generate random arrays of different sizes.
Sorting Speed Control: A slider allows users to adjust the speed of the sorting animation.
Real-time Sorting Visualization: Visual feedback during the sorting process makes it easier to understand how each algorithm works.
"Already Sorted" Detection: If the array is already sorted, the system displays a message to the user.
Multiple Algorithms: The tool implements and visualizes four sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort.
6. Design and Implementation
6.1 Array Generation
The generateArray() function generates a new array of random integers within a specified range. The array size is adjustable by the user, and the function is triggered by the "New Array" button.

6.2 Sorting Visualization
Each sorting algorithm is implemented as an asynchronous function. Sorting algorithms, such as Bubble Sort and Quick Sort, update the array state after each step, providing real-time visual feedback.

6.3 Already Sorted Detection
Before running any sorting algorithm, the system checks if the array is already sorted using the checkIfSorted() function. If the array is sorted, the visualizer displays the message "Array is already sorted!" and skips sorting.

7. Challenges Faced
Synchronizing animations: One of the main challenges was ensuring that animations and array updates happen smoothly and in real-time without performance degradation.
Efficient Array Comparison: Implementing an efficient method to detect whether an array is already sorted before running any algorithm required careful thought, especially for larger arrays.
8. Conclusion
This project has successfully provided a dynamic and interactive platform for visualizing sorting algorithms. It is a valuable learning tool for students to understand how different sorting techniques work and how they differ in performance. The project also emphasizes user interaction through controls that allow for customization of array size and sorting speed.

9. Future Enhancements
More Algorithms: We could include additional algorithms like Heap Sort and Radix Sort to make the tool even more comprehensive.
Time Complexity Display: Showing the time complexity of the currently selected sorting algorithm during execution.
Algorithm Comparisons: Comparing the performance of different sorting algorithms on the same array side by side.
Mobile-Friendly Interface: Optimize the tool for mobile devices, making it accessible to a wider audience.
Dark Mode: Add a dark mode for improved user experience during extended use.
